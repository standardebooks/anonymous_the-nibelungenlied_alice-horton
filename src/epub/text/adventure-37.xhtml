						<span>The sorrowing of Etzel</span>
						<span>so great was, that the noise</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Was even as a lion’s⁠—</span>
						<span>the mighty king his voice</span>
					</span>

						<span>eke mourn’d his wife no less:</span>
					</span>
					<br/>

						<span>with utmost bitterness.</span>
