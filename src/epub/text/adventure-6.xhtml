						<span>Fresh rumours now were coming</span>
						<span>from over Rhine: for there</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>As all the folk were saying</span>
						<span>was many a maiden fair.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Of these was good King Gunther</span>
						<span>now thinking one to woo,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>And high his knightly ardour</span>
						<span>rose, as this purpose grew.</span>

						<span>There was a great queen, dwelling,</span>
						<span>somewhere beyond the sea,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Whose like none had seen ever,</span>
						<span>and ne'er again would see.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>She was of matchless beauty,</span>
						<span>and strong withal of make;—</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>She shot with ready warriors,</span>
						<span>and made her love the stake.</span>

					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>He, who her love did covet,</span>
						<span>must, without wavering,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Win three games in succession</span>
						<span>from her, the highborn maid;—</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>And if he failed in any,</span>
						<span>his head was forfeited.</span>

						<span>Thus many a time and often</span>

						<span>'Twas one day heard in Rhineland,</span>
						<span>by a good knight and true.</span>
					</span>

					<span>
						<span>Who turned his thoughts towards her,</span>

						<span>And if the fair Brunhilda</span>
						<span>doth come here to this land,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>I'll give my sister to thee,</span>

						<span>Before the high-bom lady</span>
						<span>home to the Rhine they brought.</span>

						<span>Siegfried his hood of darkness,</span>

					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>The same that the bold hero,</span>
						<span>after hard fight, did make</span>

					<span>
						<span>His own, from a dwarf wrested,</span>

					<span>
						<span>A hidden strength was in him</span>
						<span>he had not known before:</span>

					<span>
						<span>He had the strength of twelve men,</span>
