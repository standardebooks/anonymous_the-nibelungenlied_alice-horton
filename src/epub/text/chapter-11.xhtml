			<h2>ADVENTURE XI.— HOW SIEGFRIED WENT HOME WITH HIS WIFE.</h2>

690. 
Now that the guests departing all on their way were sped, 
Siegfried the son of Siegmund unto his people said : 
" We likewise must make ready home to our land to go." 
Well liked his wife these tidings, when she the news did know. 

691. 
She spake unto her husband : " When must we needs set out ? 
That I should go thus quickly I very much misdoubt ; 
For firstly must my brothers with me the kingdom share." 
'Twas irksome unto Siegfried from Kriemhild this to hear. 

692. 
The princes went unto him and spake to him, all three : 
" Now be assured, Sir Siegfried, that yours shall ever be 
Our true and faithful service, ay, even unto death ! " 
He bowed unto the princes who pledged him thus their faith. 

693- 
" We would with you share also," said Giselher the young, 
" The lands and eke the castles which unto us belong. 
Whate'er of this wide kingdom be subject to our rule. 
Together with Kriemhilda, that shall you share in full." 

694. 
Thereon the son of Siegmund said to the princes three, 
As soon as of these nobles the goodwill he did see : 
"Your heritage, God grant it for ever blessed be, 
And eke the folk within it ! But, for my dear wife, she

695- 
" Gladly foregoes the portion that ye to her would give. 
A crown she'll soon be wearing, and, if we both should live. 
She'll be, in sooth, far richer than any living bride. 
In aught else at your service I'll loyally abide." 

696. 
Then spake the lady Kriemhfld : " Though naught my land you 

deem, 
Burgundian thanes should never stand in such small esteem ! 
To lead them to his country right glad a king might be. 
Ay ! let my own dear brothers e'en share in all with me." 

697. 

Then spake the noble Gemot : " Take whom thou hast a mind; 
Of those who would ride with thee, thou here wilt plenty find ! 
Of thirty hundred warriors a thousand we'll give thee 
To be thine own attendants." Then Kriemhild speedily 

698. 
For Hagen sent, of Tronj^, and likewise for Ortwein : 
"Will ye and eke your kinsmen," she asked, " be men of mine?" 
But Hagen, when he heard it, cried in a mood of wrath : 
" Nay, Gunther may not give us to anyone on earth ! 

699. 

*' Let others of your household attend you on your way, 
Well might you know by this time the customs of Tronj^ 
Upon the king attending at court we choose to stay, — 
Whom we thus far have folio w'd, we still would serve alway," 

700. 
*Twas therefore so decided : to start they did prepare. 
As noble court-attendants Dame Kriemhild took with her 
Of maidens two-and-thirty, besides five hundred men. 
Sir Eckewart, the Margrave, went with Kriemhilda then.

701. 

Then was a great leave-taking, of squire as well as knight, 
Of maiden and of matron : as was indeed but right. 
Friend kissing friend at parting was seen on every hand : 
Right gaily they departed from out King Gunther's land. 

702. 
Their kinsmen did escort them far out uppn the way. 
And camping-grounds were fix'd on, where they the night 

should stay, — 
Wherever seem'd good to them throughout the kings' domain. 
Swift messengers to Siegmund the tidings bear amain 

703- 
That he and Dame Sieglinda, might straight be made aware 
How that their son was coming, with Ute's daughter fair, — 
The beauteous Kriemhilda, of Worms on the Rhine-strand. 
No dearer news and better could e'er have come to hand. 

704. 
" Ah, well for me," quoth Siegmund, " that I this day have known 
When beauteous Kriemhilda comes hither for a crown ! 
Mine heritage I reckon thereby a worthier thing : 
My son, the noble Siegfried, shall here himself be king." 

705- 
Then gave the Lady Sieglind much velvet of red hue, 
And weighty gold and silver, that was their herald's due ; 
So much the news rejoiced her which she had heard that day. 
With zeal her waiting-maidens now donn'd their best array. 

706. 
Folks talk'd of who was coming with Siegfried to their land. 
They bade men raise a platform, with benches close at hand, 
Wherefrom his friends might see him as with his crown he rode. 
King Siegmund's men went forward to meet him on the road.

707. 
If any better welcome to heroes aye befell 
Than in this land of Siegmund, it is not mine to tell. 
To meet the fair Kriemhilda Sieglind herself did ride, 
With many a lovely lady and gallant knights beside. 

yoS. 
After a whole day's journey at length the guests they spied. 
Both native-born and strangers did weary of the ride, 
Before they reached a fortress, — a castle large and strong, — 
'Twas Santen hight ; and therein they wore their crowns erelong. 

709. 
With smiling lips and loving, Sieglind and Siegmund too 
Greeted the fair Kriemhilda, with kisses not a few ; 
They did the like to Siegfried ; now gone was all their pain. 
Their followers did likewise a hearty welcome gain. 

710. 
They bade the guests be taken in front of Siegmund's hall. 
And there the beauteous maidens were holpen, one and all, 
To dismount from their palfreys ; and there was many a man 
Who on these lovely women to wait with zeal began. 

711. 

How grand soe'er the wedding had been upon the Rhine, 
Here did they give the heroes apparel far more fine 
Than they, in all their lifetime, had ever worn before. 
One might tell mickle marvels of all their wealth in store. 

712. 
They sate in state and splendour, and had of all enough. 
What raiment wore their servants of golden-colour'd stuff ! 
With broider'd lace adorned, and precious stones inwrought ! 
The noble Queen Sieglinda of this had taken thought. 



122 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

713- 
Before his friends and kinsmen then noble Siegmund spake : 
" I charge all Siegfried's kinsfolk notice hereby to take, 
That he, before these warriors, my crown henceforth shall wear." 
This news the Netherlanders were glad in sooth to hear. 

714. 
To him he gave his kingdom, his crown, and government. 
Henceforth he was their master. And his arbitrament 
And rendering of justice became abiding law; — 
So that fair Kriemhild's husband was greatly held in awe. 

715- 
In this estate of honour, he lived, as all declare, 
And wore the crown and govern'd, — until, in the tenth year. 
His comely wife in safety brought forth her first-born son ; 
Whereat the royal kinsfolk were gladden'd ev'ryone. 

716. 
They hasten'd to baptize him, and gave him for a name. 
After his uncle, Gunther, which could not bring him shame. 
Were he but as his forbears, a brave man he would grow. 
They gave him careful training, as bounden so to do. 

717. 

About the self-same season Dame Sieglind pass'd away. 
Then noble Ute's daughter did over all hold sway, — 
As doth beseem such ladies who wealth and lands possess. 
That Death the queen had taken they mourned none the less. 

718. 
Now yonder too, in Rhineland, — so doth the story run, — 
Unto the wealthy Gunther there had been born a son 
Of beauteous Brunhilda, in realm of Burgundy ; 
And, for the love of Siegfried, that hero's name had he. 



XL] HOW SIEGFRIED WENT HOME WITH HIS WIFE. 1 23 

719. 
With what great care unceasing that child was watch'd and 

taught ! 
For him the noble Gunther caused teachers to be sought, 
To rear him in all virtues befitting man's estate. 
Alas ! how in his kinsfolk he found an evil fate ! 

720. 
In legends old, the story hath many a time been told, 
Of how those gallant warriors lived in the days of old ; 
Worthy of praise, at all times, in good King Siegmund's land. 
The like did also Gunther and all his knightly band. 

721. 

The kingdom of the Niblungs was under Siegfried's sway — 
Among his wealthy kinsfolk there was no wealthier aye — 
And Schilbung's warriors also, and all their goods and gold. 
Well might the gallant warrior his head more highly hold. 

722. 
The greatest of all treasures that ever hero won, 
Save they that erst-time held it, the gallant knight did own ; — 
Which once upon a mountain he wrested by his might ; 
He did to death to gain it full many a doughty knight. 

723- 
He had his fill of honour ; and had it not been so, 
In justice to the hero one needs must own, I trow. 
That he among the best was that e'er on horseback sat ; 
Men fear'd his strength of body ; with reason did they that.
