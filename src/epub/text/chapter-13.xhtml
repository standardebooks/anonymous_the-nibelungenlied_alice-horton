			<h2>ADVENTURE XIII.— HOW THEY JOURNEYED TO THE FESTIVAL.</h2>

778. 
Now in their stir and bustle awhile we'll let them be, 
And tell how Dame Kriemhilda and her fair company 
Hence, on their journey Rhinewards, from Niblung-land did go. 
No horses of fine raiment e'er bore so grand a show. 

779- 
When many sumpter-coffers were ready for the way, 
Then with his friends Sir Siegfried no longer did delay 
To ride forth, with Kriemhilda, wherein they look'd for joy. 
For all of them soon after it turn'd to sore annoy. 

780. 
They left at home behind them Sir Siegfried's baby son. 
The firstborn of Kriemhilda, — not elsewise could be done. 
From out of their state- journey arose much woe and pain : 
His father and his mother that babe saw ne'er again. 

781. 
Thence also did Lord Siegmund together with them ride. 
Had he but known what evil thereafter would betide 
At this same courtly banquet, he ne'er had gone at all : 
To him by loss of kindred worse ill could ne'er befall. 



134 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

782. 
Heralds were sent before them the news betimes to say. 
And soon rode out to meet them, in lordliest array, 
Many of Ute's kinsfolk and Gunther's gallant men. 
The host began to stir him his guests to welcome then. 

783. 
He went unto Brunhilda where seated was the dame : 
" How did my sister greet you," quoth he, " when first you came? 
Even in the self-same fashion you Siegfried's wife must greet." 
Said she : " That will I gladly ; I love her, as is meet." 

784. 
Then spake the great king : " Early to-morrow are they due. 
If you would fain receive them, be quick in what you do ; 
Lest we have first to greet them in this our citadel. 
In all my days I have not had guests I loved so well." 

785. 

Her maidens and her women she therefore straightway bade 
To go and seek fine raiment, the best that could be had, — 
Such as her own attendants might wear her guests before. 
This did they with much pleasure, of that you may be sure ! 

786. 
King Gunther's men now hasten'd to tender service due. 
The host about his person had all his warriors true. 
The queen herself rode with him, all gloriously array'd ; 
To these well-lov€d guests was a royal welcome made. 

787. 
With what unfeign'd rejoicing the guests by all were met ! 
'Twas said that Dame Brunhilda did ne'er such greeting get 
In the Burgundian kingdom on the part of Dame Kreimhild. 
They who had ne'er beheld her with happiness were fiU'd. 



XIII.] HOW THEY JOURNEYED TO THE FESTIVAL. 1 35 

788. 
By this time was arrived Sir Siegfried with his men. 
One saw the heroes riding forwards and back again 
In all parts of the meadows, a vast and shapeless host ; 
None there could get away from the thronging and the dust. 

789. 
Now when the country's ruler did gallant Siegfried see, 
Together with King Siegmund, how courteously spake he : 
"Ye are to me right welcome, and unto every friend ! 
I trow your royal visit in joy to us will end." 

790. 
** God prosper you ! " quoth Siegmund, that honour-loving man. 
" Since my son Siegfried's friendship for you and yours began. 
'Twas aye my hope and purpose one day your face to see." 
King Gunther said : " I also am glad that it should be." 

791. 
Then was Siegfried received, as well did him beseem, 
With ev'ry fitting honour : which none amiss did deem. 
And Giselher and Gemot did lend all courteous aid. 
Methinks to no guests ever were kindlier honours paid. 

792. 
And now the two kings' spouses anigh each other came. 
Empty was many a saddle, as many a beauteous dame 
Was by the hands of heroes dismounted on the grass : 
For those who loved fair women no Httle work there was ! 

793- 
Then lovingly the ladies unto each other went ; 
And many a knight who saw it was heartily content 
That of these twain the greeting so handsomely befell. 
Then many a warrior saw one stand by each damosel. 



136 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

794- 
The throng of noble people each other's hands did take ; 
Whilst men unto each other their courtly bows did make, 
The ladies fair were kissing each other lovingly, — 
Which Siegfried's men and Gunther's right joyous were to see. 

795- 

No longer did they linger, but rode towards the town. 
The host meanwhile had bidden that every guest be shown 
How truly he was welcome to royal Burgundy. 
Then many a match was tilted for maidens fair to see. 

796. 
And Hagen, too, from Tronje, and Ortewein also, 
That they were men of power did all they could to show; 
And whatsoe'er they order'd that durst no man gainsay. 
Unto the guests so welcome much service offer'd they. 

797. 
The clang of shields resounded before the castle-gate 
From many a thrust and parry ; and long thereby did wait 
The host and guests together, ere within doors they came ; 
Ay, ajp-d the hours sped quickly with many a merry game. 

798. 
Before the stately palace all joyously they rode ; 
And many fine-wrought housings, of handsome stuff and mode 
Were seen upon the saddles of many a well-dight dame. 
On either side low-hanging. Then Gunther's chieftains came. 

799- 
The guests unto their chambers were taken presently. 
One saw how Lady Brunhild at times would cast her eye 
Toward the Lady Kriemhild, who verily was fair. 
Her colour in bright beauty might well with gold compare. 



XIII.] HOW THEY JOURNEYED TO THE FESTIVAL. 1 37 

800. 
At Worms was heard the turmoil, on all sides of the town, 
Of these incoming strangers. King Gunther made it known 
Unto his marshal, Dankwart, that he for these must care ; 
So did he for the people good lodging-room prepare. 

801. 
Both out of doors and indoors they e'en might feast their fill. 
Ay ! ne'er before were strangers welcomed with more goodwill. 
Whatever they desired was ready at their side : 
So wealthy was King Gunther to none was aught denied. 

802. 
Served were they in all friendship and banish'd was all hate; 
The host himself at table with all the guest-folk sate. 
Siegfried must now his seat take where he afore had done ; 
There went to table with him full many a worthy one. 

803. 
Twelve hundred gallant warriors were round the table seen 
Sitting with him and feasting. Then thought Brunhild the queen, 
That ne'er a sovran ruler could ever have more wealth. 
Still leaned she so towards him she could but wish him health. 

804. 
And verily that evening, while the king sat there yet. 
Right many a costly garment was by the wine made wet, 
As the cup-bearers quickly around the table went. 
The servants there were many, and all right diligent. 

805. 
As long had been the custom when festival was made, 
Unto the maids and matrons a fair good-night they bade. 
To whomsoever came there the host a welcome gave. 
In kindliness and honour they all enough could have. 



138 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

806. 
As soon as night was ended and the next daylight shone, 
The packing-chests were open'd, and many a precious stone 
Shone bright on goodly raiment, by lady's hand shown forth. 
Then was to sight unfolded full many a robe of worth. 

807. 
Ere yet it was broad daylight the knights and squires came out 
Before the hall in numbers ; again began the rout 
Or ever early mass had before the king been sung. 
Then thanks for featly riding he gave the heroes young. 

808. 
Soon shrill and loud resounded full many a trumpet-blast. 
From drums and pipes together there was a noise so vast, 
That Worms, the great, wide city, loud echoed to the call. 
Upon their chargers mounted the haughty heroes all. 

809. 
Throughout the land began then a mighty tournament, 
Where many a good knight tilted ; and thereto many went, 
Whose youthful hearts and eager beat high in gallant mood ; 
Behind their shields one saw them, gay warriors and good. 

810. 
And at their windows seated look'd down the stately dames 
And beauteous, well-dight maidens, intent to watch the games, 
And see the merry jousting of the bold knights below. 
The host amongst his lieges himself would riding go. 

811. 
Thus were the hours beguiled, and none did deem them long, 
Until the minster-belfry did call to evensong. 
Then were brought round the palfreys ; the dames to ride began ; 
The noble queens were follow'd by many a gallant man. 



XIV.] HOW THE QUEENS RAILED AT ONE ANOTHER. 1 39 

812. 
Alighting at the minster, they stood down on the grass. 
Unto her guests Brunhilda so far right friendly was. 
Into the wide cathedral, wearing their crowns of state. 
They went : ere long love changed to jealousy and hate. 

813. 

When they to mass had listen'd they left the church, and so 
Rode oif with many honours. One saw them later go 
All gaily to the banquet. Their pleasure knew no stay, 
And all was merrymaking until the eleventh day.
