			<h2>Adventure XVIII.— HOW SIEGMUND WENT BACK TO HIS OWN LAND.</h2>

1073. 
Kriemhilda's husband's father had to her presence come. 
And to the queen thus spake he : " We now would fain go home > 
I trow that we in Rhineland, unwelcome guests must be. 
Kriemhilda, dearest lady, come to my land with me. 

1074. 
" Since that your noble husband, by treason underhand, 
Hath from us all been taken here in this very land, 
You must not overlook it : I will be kind to you 
For love of my son Siegfried ; doubt not that this is true. 

1075- 
Henceforward also, Lady, to you the power I'll yield 
That the bold warrior Siegfried did teach you how to wield. 
The land and the crown likewise shall subject be to you; 
And all of Siegfried's vassals will gladly service do." 

1076. 
Then were the servants bidden that thence they were to ride ; — 
It was a mighty business the horses to provide ! 
Amidst their bitter foemen to dwell were sorry cheer. 
They bade the dames and maidens to seek their travelling gear.

1077. 
And when King Siegmund also was ready forth to ride, 
The kinsmen of Kriemhilda besought her to abide : 
Her place was with her mother, and there to stay ought she. 
Then spake the noble lady : " Nay, that can hardly be ! 

1078. 
" How could I bear for ever him with these eyes to see, 
Through whom to me, poor woman, hath come such misery ? " 
Then Giselher, the youthful, made answer : " Sister dear, 
For duty's sake now shouldst thou bide with thy mother here. 

1079. 

" Of them who have distress'd thee, and brought thee to despair, 
Thou dost require no service; my fortune thou shalt share." 
But to the knight she answer'd : " Nay, this can never be ; 
I needs must die of sorrow if I should Hagen see." 

1080. 
" I'll see that doth not happen, my sister dear," quoth he, 
" With Giselher thy brother in safety shouldst thou be ; 
Amends will I make to thee, for thy dear husband's death." 
Then spake the poor forlorn one : "True need Kriemhilda hath !" 

1081. 
When this so kindly offer to her the young man made, 
Ut^ and also Gemot fell Hkewise to persuade, 
With all her faithful kinsfolk : they begged her not to go : 
For amongst Siegfried's kindred not many did she know. 

1082. 
"They are all strangers to thee," Gemot began to say; 
" So strong is no man living but he must die one day. 
Bethink thee then, dear sister, and comfort thy sad mood ; 
Stay with thy friends and kinsmen : it will be for thy good."

1083. 
So Giselher she proirn.^ed that there she would abide. 
The hor£c:i all were ready for Siegmund's men to ride, — 
Who would be homeward riding unto the Niblung-land ; 
The pack-horses all laden with knightly gear did stand. 

1084. 
Lord Siegmund came, and standing before Kriemhilda, then 
Said he unto the lady: "The whole of Siegfried's men 
Await you by the horses ; 'tis time we rode awa 
For willingly I would not with the Burgundians lay." 

1085. 
But lady Kriemhild' answer'd : " My friends their counsel give — 
So many as are faithful — that I with them sho ' ' v : 
For I have ne'er a kinsman within the Niblung 
Sad was the heart of Siegmund when he did ur ieistand. 

1086. 
Then answer'd her King Siegmund : " Let that >..uu uy r, 
Rather than to my kinsmen I'll give to you my :rown. 
With power and might you'll wear it, as you have done before ; 
You shall be none the worse that our hero is no more. 

1087. 
" Come back with us, if only it were for your child's sake : 
You surely will not, lady, the babe an orphan make. 
When once your son a man is he'll comfort your sad mood ; 
Meanwhile you'll have the service of many heroes good." 

1088. 
She spake : " Sir Siegmund, truly I cannot with you ride. 
Whate'er may happen to me here must I still abide 
Among my friends and kinsfolk, and mourn with me they will." 
The good knights at this answer began to take it ill.

1089. 
With one accord they answer'd : ** Then mv.n we fain confess 
That for the first time, truly, our hearts knew bitterness. 
Since you indeed are wiUing here with our foes to bide . 
On such a grievous journey did heroes never ride." 



1090. 
Said she : " Ye may, God-speeding, without foreboding fare : 
Safe-conduct shall be given — of that I'll have a care — 
From here to Siegmund's country. As for my darling child, 
Unto ye knights i trust him, and to your mercies mild !" 

1091. 
When they were well persuaded that thence she would not go, 
The lieges all of Siegmund did weep for very woe. 
How full of bitter sorrow was Siegmund when his leave 
He took of dame Kriemhilda ! Then knew he how to grieve. 

1092. 
"Woe be on these great doings," the noble king quoth he : 
*' An ending worse of pleasure there ne'er again can be 
10 king yji to u.^ kinsfolk, than this to us has been. 
No more shall we henceforward in Burgundy be seen." 

1093. 
Then loud, that all might hear them, the men of Siegfried spake: 
" Yet once again the journey may we to this land make, 
When we shall have discover'd who laid our master low. 
They'll have among his kinsfolk stout enemies enow ! " 

1094. 
And so he kiss'd Kriemhilda ; and mournfully did say, 
Whenas he saw for certain she had a mind to stay : 
" Now will we unrejoicing go home unto our land. 
My sorrow for the first time now do I understand."

1095. 
From Worms without an escort unto the Rhine they rode ; 
Well might they, notwithstanding, be confident of mood, 
That if they should of foemen an onset have to ward. 
The hands of stalwart Niblungs would serve them for a guard. 

1096. 
Leave did they take of no man ere they set forth to ride. 
But Giselher and Gemot were presently espied 
All kindly coming t'wards him : his sorrow made them grieve, 
As soon these gallant heroes did bring him to believe. 

1097. 
For then the princely Gemot right courteously said : 
" Be God in Heaven my witness ! that Siegfried now is dead 
Is through no fault on my part, nor have I heard men tell 
Who wish'd him any evil : so can I mourn him well." 

1098. 
Then had they a safe-conduct at Giselher's own hand ; 
And carefully he led them in time, from out the land. 
The king and all his warriors to Netherland got home. 
How little could their kindred rejoice to see them come ! 

1099. 
And what befell them after I cannot rightly say. 
And still one heard Kriemhilda bewailing day by day 
That none could give her comfort, in either heart or mood, 
But Giselher, who only was true to her and good. 

1100. 
The beauteous Brunhilda still arrogantly sat : 
Howe'er Kriemhilda fretted she took no thought for that, 
And never more in goodwill did turn to her again. 
Erelong the dame Kriemhilda did wring her heart with pain.
