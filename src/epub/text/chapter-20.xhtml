			<h2>Adventure XXI— HOW KRIEMHILDA WENT TO THE HUNS.</h2>

1290. 
Leave we the heralds riding : we must make known to you 
How the Queen's j ourney prosper'd, as she the land rode through ; 
And where from her did Gemot and Giselher depart. 
Right truly each had served her, as taught of faithful heart. 

1291. 
They rode as far as Pfoering, upon the Danube-strand. 
Then of the queen began they kind quittance to demand, 
Since homeward they returning unto the Rhine would ride : 
Nor might this without weeping 'twixt loving friends betide. 

1292. 

Then Giselher the ready unto his sister said : 
" If ever thou, fair lady, shouldst stand in need of aid, 
If e'er thou art in danger, fail not to let me know. 
To Etzel's land to serve thee I presently will go." 

1293. 
Those who were of her kindred upon the mouth she kist ; 
And at the hour of parting full many a loving tryst 
One saw the liegemen keeping of margrave Riideger : 
For many a well-dight maiden the queen led forth with her. 

1294. 
Five score and four in number : rich clothing did they wear 
And brightly tinctured cloth-stuffs : and many men did bear 
Broad shields to guard the ladies beside them on the way. 
But many a princely warrior must part from them that day.

1295. 
Thence rode they swiftly forward down through Bavarian land. 
The people told the tidings of how a mickle band 
Of unknown guests were coming, nigh where a cloister still 
Doth stand, and where Inn river the Danube's flood doth fill. 

1296. 
Within the town of Passau there was a bishop's see. 
The hostels and the palace stood empty presently: 
To meet the guests men hied them on to Bavarian ground, 
Where Pilgerin the bishop the fair Kriemhilda found. 

1297. 
The warriors of the country no whit displeased were 
To see behind her coming so many ladies fair, 
Their eyes upon these daughters of noble knights did rest. 
Good lodging was provided for every noble guest. 

1298. 
The bishop into Passau, his niece beside him, rode ; 
And when among the burghers the news was noised abroad 
That coming was Kriemhilda, their prince's sister's child. 
Right gladly was she welcomed by all the merchant guild. 

1299. 
That they were come to sojourn the bishop fain had known, 
But Eckewart said to him : " It is not to be done ; 
To Riideger's dominions we needs must journey down. 
Where many knights await us : as is to all well-known." 

1300. 
The tidings of their coming now fair Gotlinda knew. 
Straightway she made her ready, her noble daughter too. 
For Riideger had warn'd her that he would deem it good 
If when the queen was coming — to somewhat cheer her mood— 



222 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1301. 
She would ride forth to meet her, with escort of his men, 
Unto the river Ense ; which being accomplished, then 
On every side beheld one the very roads alive 
With folk, on foot or horseback, — to see the guests arrive 

1302. 
Now was the queen by this time to Everdingen come. 
No few of the Bavarians did then as outlaws roam. 
To rob upon the highways ; and they, as was their wont, 
Might to the guests have offer'd some dangerous affront. 

But well the noble margrave of this had taken thought ; 
For he a thousand warriors and even more had brought. 
There also came Gotlinda, the wife of Riideger, 
And many a knight of valour right nobly rode with her. 

1304. 
When they the Traun had traversed, upon the level green 
By Ens, folk making ready cabins and tents were seen ; 
For there it was determined the night-halt should be made. 
All charges for the strangers by Riideger were paid. 

^305- 
The fair Gotlinda stay'd not upon the camping ground, 
But forward went to meet them. Along the roadway wound 
With ever tinkling trappings a handsome cavalcade. 
Right kindly was her greeting, — which Riideger made glad. 

1306. 
And those whom either party encounter'd on the way 
Rode in praiseworthy fashion ; right many thanes were they. 
They practised knightly pastimes, by many a maiden seen ; 
Nor was the warriors' service unpleasing to the queen.

1307. 

As Riideger's retainers unto the guests came nigh, 
Right many were the lance-shafts one saw raised up on high. 
By warriors' hands upUfted, as is the knightly mode ; 
And then before the ladies praiseworthily they rode. 

1308. 
This brought they to an ending ; then many of the men 
Greeted each other kindly. The fair Gotlinda then 
To where she saw Kriemhilda they brought upon her way. 
They who could serve the ladies had Uttle rest that day. 

1309. 
The lord of Bechelaren up to his wife did ride ; 
The noble lady-margrave was right well satisfied 
That he from the Rhine country all safe and sound had won. 
And somewhat was her sorrow in happiness undone. 

1310. 

When she had made him welcome, he bade her on the green 
Dismount, with all the ladies who in her train were seen. 
Then many a noble liegeman was busy as could be ; 
And service to the ladies was done right readily. 

1311. 
As now the lady Kriemhild the margravine espied, 
Standing with her attendants, she would no nearer ride ; 
But with the rein her palfrey at once began to stay, 
And bade them from the saddle to lift her down straightway. 

1312, 

His sister's daughter leading one saw the bishop soon, 
With Eckewart, to make her unto Gotlinda known ; 
And, in a trice, the people made wide the way for this. 
Upon the lips the stranger did Gotelinda kiss.

1313- 
Then spake in loving fashion the wife of Riideger : 
" Now well is me, dear lady, that I thy presence fair 
Within my country's borders and with mine eyes have seen. 
To me could at this season no greater joy have been." 

13140 
" Most noble Gotelinda, God give you your reward ! 
If haply I," spake Kriemhild, " and Botlung's son be spared, 
One day you may be joyful that you have seen my face." 
They both were all unknowing of what must come to pass. 

Due courtesies exchanging, walk'd many maidens fair ; 
Their services to render the warriors ready were. 
They sat, the greetings ended, upon the clover down, 
And many made acquaintance, who were till then unknown. 

1316. 
Wine brought they for the ladies ; and now 'twas full midday ; 
The noble folk would therefore no longer there delay. 
They rode on till they came where large huts and many stood, 
And for the noble strangers was waiting service good. 

1317- 
That night they slept in quiet until the dawning brake. 
But they of Bechelaren themselves did ready make, 
So that they might provide for so many a worthy guest. 
Well Riideger had managed that little should be miss'd. 

1318. 
One saw how every window stood open in the wall : 
The castle of Bechlaren was entry-free to all. 
Therein the guests came riding, well seen of all around. 
The noble host had bidden good hostel to be found.

1319- 
Then Riideger's fair daughter with all her company, 
Unto the queen approaching, received her lovingly. 
There likewise was her mother, the wife of the margrave. 
To many a young damsel they kindly greeting gave. 

1320. 

Hands took they with each other, and so together went 
Unto a wide-room'd palace of fashion excellent. 
For there, beneath it rushing, one saw the Danube's flood. 
They sat and took the breezes, and had much pastime good. 

1321. 

Of what they did there further I cannot say a word. 
That so much time was wasted complaints, howe'er, were heard, — 
Made by Kriemhilda's warriors, whose patience thus was tried. 
But with them, from Bechlaren what goodly thanes did ride ! 

1322. 

By Riideger kind service was amply offered. 
The queen bestow'd, when leaving, twelve golden bracelets red 
On Gotelinda's daughter, and raiment, too, well-wrought : 
She into Etzel's country herself no better brought. 

1323- 
Although they had despoil'd her of all the Niblung gold, 
The love of all who saw her she knew to win and hold 
With what small wealth remaining she for her use might have. 
Unto her host's house-servants great store of gifts she gave. 

1324. 
Like honour show'd on her side the lady Gotelind 
Unto the guests from Rhineland ; to whom she was so kind 
That one could find scarce any among the strangers there 
Who had not of her jewels or raiment fine to wear. 

Q

1325- 
When they enough had eaten, and time it was to start, 
The mistress of the household proffer'd, with all her heart, 
Most true and loyal service to Etzel's wife to-be. 
Then was the fair young maiden embraced right lovingly. 

1326. 
Unto the Queen thus spake she : " If it seem good to you, 
I know that my dear father right gladly this will do : 
He'll send me into Hunsland that I with you may be." 
That she was loyal-hearted Kriemhilda well could see. 

1327. 
In front of Bechelaren the horses had been led ; 
The noble queen already her parting words had said 
Unto the wife and daughter of margrave Riideger ; 
With greetings, too, departed full many a maiden fair. 

1328. 
They scarce from that day forward saw one another more. 
And when they came to Medhck, lo ! in their hands men bore 
A store of brave gold flagons, wherein, unto the street, 
Wine brought they for the strangers ; to give them welcome meet. 

1329. 
There was a lord of manor here dwelling, hight Astold ; 
Into the Austrian country the way to them he told : 
By Mautern, somewhat further the Danube stream adown. 
There right true service later the mighty queen did own. 

1330. 
Unto his niece the bishop a loving farewell bade ; 
To be of cheerful spirit her earnestly he pray'd, 
And win herself such honour as Helka erst had done. 
Ay ! what great honour later amongst the Huns she won I

1331- 
Unto the Traisen river the guests they soon did bring ; 
And Riideger's retainers served them, unwearying, 
Until the Hun-folk riding across the country came. 
Then was there mickle honour done to the royal dame. 

1332. 
The king of the Huns' country did, near the Traisen, own 
A very noble stronghold, to everyone well known. 
Its name was Traisenmauer, where Helka lived of yore, 
And practised such great virtues, scarce met with any more, 

1333- 

Save only in Kriemhilda ; — for she knew how to give ; — 
And, after all her sorrow, was for some joy to live. 
In that she also honour of Etzel's folk might have ; 
Which soon, in fullest measure, the heroes to her gave. 

1334. 
The sovereignty of Etzel was own'd so far and wide 
That at his court were met with, at every time and tide, 
The bravest of all warriors whose names were known to fame 
'Mongst Christians or heathens : all thither to him came. 

1335- 
With him there was at all times — which scarce again can come — 
The Christian confession along with heathendom. 
Whatever rule of living each for himself might have, 
The king's mood was so easy, plenty to all he gave.
