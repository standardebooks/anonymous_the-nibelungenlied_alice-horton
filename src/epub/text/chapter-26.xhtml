			<h2>Adventure XXVII.— HOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN.</h2>

1650. 

Away then went the margrave to where the ladies were, 
His wife and eke their daughter ; — to them the tidings fair 
That had but now been brought him he told right speedily : 
That soon their lady's brothers beneath their roof would be. 

1651. 
" My own and well-lov'd sweetheart," so Riideger then spake, 
"These noble kings and mighty we must right welcome make, 
Since they and all their followers are on their way to court. 
And Hagen, Gunther's liegeman, thou must greet in good sort. 

1652. 
" With him there comes another, by name one Dankwart hight ; 
And yet a third call'd Volker, a well-bred, courtly knight. 
These six must thou, Gotlinda, and thou, my daughter, kiss, 
And let not any warrior a fitting welcome miss. 



282 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1653. 
This promised both the ladies and did themselves prepare, 
And sought from out their coffers for raiment rich to wear, 
That they to meet the warriors in fit attire might go. 
Amidst the comely damsels there was a great to-do. 

1654. 
Of painted women's faces one found there few enough. 
They wore upon their foreheads bright bands of golden stuff, 
Like costly chaplets fashion'd, that thus their lovely hair 
The wind should not dishevel : 'tis truth that I declare. 

1655. 
Now let us leave the ladies in all this business. 
Across the open country all eager was the press 
Of Riideger's retainers to where the princes stay'd ; 
Within the margrave's county right welcome were they made. 

1656. 
As soon as towards him coming the margrave them espied, 
How Riideger the valiant in words of gladness cried : 
" Be ye, my lords, right welcome, and likewise all your men ; 
How glad am I to see you here in my own domain ! " 

1657. 
In trust, with no misliking, the warriors to him bow'd ; 
That he all goodwill bore them to all he plainly show'd. 
Apart he greeted Hagen, a friend of old was he ; 
And did the like to Volker, the knight of Burgundy. 

1658. 
Dankwart he also greeted ; whereon that bold thane spake : 
" Since thou wilt give us shelter, pray, who shall undertake 
To cater for our people whom we have brought so far ? " 
Then answer'd him the margrave : " This night be free from care. 



xxvil] how they came to bechelaren. 283 

1659. 

*' And as to all your people, and aught that in your band, 
Horses be it, or raiment, hath come unto this land. 
So safely will I guard them and all from loss insure, 
That ye shall have no damage, nay, not by a single spur. 

1660. 

" So pitch your tents, ye yeomen, upon the open ground, 
For any loss ye suffer I'm willing to be bound. 
Take off the horses' bridles and let them freely run." 
The like to them but seldom a host ere then had done. 

1661. 
Right glad of heart the guests were. When all had come to pass. 
The lords rode off together. Then down upon the grass 
On all sides lay the yeomen, and right good rest they had ; 
I ween in all the journey they ne'er so softly laid. 

1662. 
The noble margrave's lady without the castle gate 
Had gone with her fair daughter. One saw there with her wait 
A crowd of lovely women, and many a maiden fair. 
Who wore a store of armlets, and raiment rich and rare. 

1663. 
The precious gems glowed brightly, and might be seen afar 
Upon their rich apparel ; so finely clad they were. 
And now the guests arriving dismounted speedily. 
Ay me ! what gallant breeding showed they of Burgundy ! 

1664. 
Of maidens six-and-thirty and many another dame, 
As ever eye could wish for so fair in form they came. 
And went towards the strangers with many a gallant man. 
Ah, then in sooth fair greetings of noble dames began ! 



284 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1665. 
Then kiss'd the margrave's daughter the three kings fittingly, 
As also did her mother ; Hagen was standing by, 
Her father bade her kiss him ; she cast a look at him, 
And fain had she not done it — she thought he look'd so grim. 

1666. 
Yet straightway must she do it, since so the master said ; 
Her cheeks were changed in colour to mingled white and red. 
Then Dankwart likewise kiss'd she, and then the Minstrel too; 
By reason of his valour such greeting was his due. 

1667. 
The margrave's youthful daughter took presently the hand 
Of Giselher, the warrior from the Burgundian land : 
Her mother, too, did likewise to Gunther, the brave king. 
So went they with the heroes in gladness revelling. 

1668. 
The host along with Gemot went into a wide hall, 
Where they were quickly seated, both knights and ladies all : 
Good wine was call'd for straightway, which to the guests they 

gave. 
Ay, surely never heroes could better treatment have. 

1669. 
With many an eager eye-glance the men look'd lovingly 
On Riideger's young daughter : she was so fair to see. 
Ay, in his thoughts embraced her full many a warrior good, 
And right well she deserved it ; but she was proud of mood : 

1670. 
Think might they as it pleased them, such thing could not be 

done. 
And to and fro men's glances meanwhile oft lit upon 
Right many a dame and maiden ; plenty were seated there. 
Goodwill the noble minstrel unto the host did bear. 



XXVII.] HOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN. 285 

1671. 
According to the custom they sever'd then in two, 
The warriors and the ladies to separate rooms withdrew. 
In the wide hall the tables in order straight were set, 
And soon the stranger guest-folk with royal service met. 

1672. 

To do her guests more honour the noble margravine 
Sat down with them at table ; her daughter was unseen, 
Left with the younger children, where fittingly she sat ; 
The guests, who miss'd her presence, were sorely vext thereat 

1673. 
When meat and drink abundant had been enjoy'd by all 
The ladies fair were usher'd again into the hall. 
There lack'd not mirthful story, nor jesting manifold : 
Busy of tongue was Volker, a knight of mood right bold. 

1674. 

Thus spake the noble minstrel, aloud that all might heed : 
" Most rich and noble margrave, God hath with you indeed 
Dealt graciously, in granting so fair a dame for wife, 
And likewise in bestowing on you a joyous life. 

1675- 
" If haply," said the minstrel, " I were a prince of blood, 
And wore the crown of kingship, surely for wife I would 
Make choice of your fair daughter, for her my heart doth woo ; 
Lovesome she is to look on and good and noble too." 

1676. 
Then said to him the margrave : " How could it ever be, 
That any king should ask for my daughter dear of me ? 
We are but stranger-people, my wife as well as I : 
What boots it that the damsel so fair is bodily ? " 



286 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1677. 
To him made answer Gemot, that man of breeding high : 
" If I would have a sweetheart, my heart to satisfy, 
So would I such a woman be ever glad to wed." 
Then Hagen put his word in, with kindly speech, and said : 

1678. 
" 'Tis still to be remember'd Lord Giselher should wed : 
Of ancestry so noble the margravine is bred. 
That I and all his liegemen would serve her willingly, 
If with a crown upon her she came to Burgundy." 

1679. 
To Riideger this counsel in every way seem'd good. 
As likewise to Gotlinda : ay, both were glad of mood. 
And soon the chiefs so order'd that she was bride beloved 
Of Giselher the noble, as well a king behoved. 

1680. 
When aught is bound to happen who may the same gainsay ? 
Forthwith they bade the damsel to court to take her way. 
They took an oath to give him the winsome maid to wife, 
And he, on his side, promised to love her as his life. 

1681. 
They gave the maiden warrant for castles and for land, 
The noble king confirm'd it by oath and his right hand. 
As likewise did Lord Gemot, that thus it should be done. 
Then spake to them the margrave : " Though castles I have none, 

1682. 
" Yet you will I at all times in faithful friendship hold : 
I give unto my daughter of silver and of gold 
As much as five score horses may carry at their best, 
That so well-pleased, in honour, the hero's kin may rest." 



xxvil] how they came to bechelaren. 287 

1683. 

The pair were thereon bidden within a ring to stand, 

According to the custom. Of many youths a band, 

In mood for merry-making, stood opposite the twain. 

And thought what they were minded, as youngsters still are fain. 

1684. 
When they began to question, and ask'd the winsome maid 
If she would have the warrior, she was a whit dismay'd : 
And yet she still was minded to take the goodly wight ; 
She blush'd but at the question, as any maiden might. 

1685. 
Then Riideger her father bade her to answer "Yea ! " 
That she would gladly take him. Whereon, without delay, 
His white hands stretch'd towards her to fold her lovingly, 
Young Giselher came forward, — short though their joy must be ! 

1686. 
** Ye noble kings and mighty," thereon the margrave spake ; 
" When home again your journey to Burgundy ye take, 
Then I (as is the custom) will give my child to you. 
That ye may take her with you." That they engaged to do. 

1687. 
Noisy as were the revels, at last they had an end. 
The damsels to their chambers were bidden then to wend ; 
In sleep the guests, too, rested till daybreak did appear ; 
Then victuals were made ready ; for all the host took care. 

1688. 
AVhen they their fast had broken fain would they forward go 
Towards the Hunnish country. " I pray you, do not so," 
Besought their host right noble; " awhile ye yet must stay; 
Since I no guests so welcome have seen for many a day." 



288 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1689. 
To this made Dankwart answer : " That surely will not do. 
Whence will you get the victuals, the bread and wine thereto, 
Which for so many warriors you needs must have this day ? " 
The host, on hearing, answer'd : *' It boots no more to say ; 

1690. 
*' My well-Iov'd lords, so please ye, I will not be denied ; 
Ay, for a fortnight will I the meat and drink provide 
For you and all the people that hither you have brought ; 
For never hath King Etzel from me yet taken aught." 

1691. 
Howe'er they sought to help it, needs must they there abide 
Until the fourth day's dawning : then did a thing betide, 
Done of the master's bounty, and noised far and near : 
On every guest bestow'd he a horse and wearing gear. 

1692. 
This could not last much longer : thence must they forward fare. 
But Riideger the valiant could naught withhold or spare 
To testify his bounty : what any fain would take, 
That was denied to no one ; all happy would he make. 

1693. 
Then forth before the gateway their noble equerries 
Led out the saddled horses. In readiness for these 
The throng of foreign warriors came out ; their shields in hand 
They bore, for they were eager to ride to Etzel's land. 

1694. 
Thereon the master offer'd his gifts to one and all, 
Ere yet the royal strangers were come without the hall. 
With bounty and great honour he knew the way to live; 
And even his fair daughter to Giselher would give.

1695. 

Anon he gave to Gunther, that hero of great fame, 
What he, the mighty monarch, might well wear without shame— 
Though gifts he took but seldom — a coat of mail, to wit. 
O'er Riideger's hand did Gunther bow low in thanks for it. 

1696. 
Then gave he unto Gemot a sword, a good one too. 
Which afterwards in battle right gallantly he drew : 
That such a gift he gave him well pleased the margrave's wife. 
'Twas doom'd to cost, soon after, good Riideger his life. 

1697. 
Gotlinda offer'd Hagen, as courteous custom bade, 
Some tokens of her kindness, since such the king had had, 
Lest he without her aidance should on his road be sped 
Unto the royal revels ; but this he soon gainsaid. 

1698. 
" Of all the things that ever I saw," so Hagen spake, 
" Not one have I more envy hence as my own to take, 
Than yonder shield that hanging upon the wall I see : 
That would I gladly carry to Etzel's land with me." 

1699. 
The margravine no sooner had heard what Hagen said, 
Than bygone woes were waken'd, and tears she needs must shed. 
Upon the death of Nudung she sorrowfully thought, 
How Witege had slain him ; thus grief upon her wrought. 

1700. 
She spake unto the warrior : " I'll give the shield to thee. 
But would to God in Heaven that still ahve were he 
Who on his arm once bare it ! In fight he was laid low, 
And I must aye bewail him : hence comes, poor me, my woe ! *'

1701. 
Then from her seat uprose she, the noble margravine ; 
And so, the buckler grasping her snow-white hands between, 
The dame to Hagen bore it, and he thereof took hold : 
It was a gift of honour unto that warrior bold. 

1702. 
A case of polish'd leather upon its surface lay, 
A better shield and brighter ne'er shone in light of day, 
With noble gems bestudded ; had any wanted it 
To buy, perchance its value a thousand marks had quit. 

1703. 

Then, by command of Hagen, they bore the shield away. 
And now to court did Dankwart begin to wend his way. 
On him the margrave's daughter apparel rich bestow'd. 
In which ere long in Hunsland right gloriously he rode. 

1704. 
Now all these friendly tokens they were endow'd withal. 
Into the hands of any had never come at all, 
Save by the master's bounty, offer'd with such good will. 
Such foes ere long became they that him they needs must kill ! 

1705- 
Then did the ready Volker, his fiddle in his hand. 
With courtly mien approaching before Gotlinda stand. 
Sweet tunes for her he fiddled, and sang his roundelay, 
Thus would he from Bechlaren take leave to ride away. 

1706. 
The margravine then bade men to her a chest to bear ; 
Of kindly gifts and bounty ye now again must hear. 
Therefrom she took twelve armlets and put them o'er his hand: 
" These must you carry with you away to Etzel's land. 



XXVII.] HOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN. 29 1 

1707. 
*' And for my sake must wear them whene'er you go to court ; 
That when you come back hither I may have good report 
How you have done me service at that great festival." 
E'en as the lady bade him he well accomplish'd all. 

1708. 
The host said to the strangers : " Ye will the better fare 
If I myself shall lead you, and bid you how beware 
Lest anyone should do you a hurt upon the road." 
Then of his sumpter-horses each quickly had its load. 

1709. 
There stood the host all ready, and eke five hundred men 
With horses and apparel. These led he with him then 
Unto the royal wedding, — a joyous merry train ; 
Alive to Bechelaren not one came back again ! 

1 7 10, 
With many loving kisses the host his farewells said, 
As Giselher did also, by honour ever led. 
The women fair they fondled with arms around them thrown ; 
For which would many a damsel be weeping soon, alone. 

On all sides were the windows thrown open to the air. 
The host with his retainers to mount all eager were. 
I ween their hearts foreboded the mighty ills to be ; 
For many dames were weeping and maidens fair to see. 

1712. 
For dear friends left behind them, plenty at heart were sore, 
Whom they at Bechelaren would look on nevermore ; 
Yet gaily rode they onwards, and down across the sand 
Along the Danube river, unto the Hunnish land. 



292 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV 

1713- 
Then Riideger the noble, well versed in chivalry, 
Spake unto the Burgundians : " We ought not, verily, 
To hide that we are coming unto the Hunfolk near ; 
Such good news hath King Etzel ne'er had the chance to hear; 

1714. 
Down through the Austrian kingdom the messenger rode fast ; 
Soon to the folk on all sides from mouth to mouth it pass'd. 
That coming were the heroes from Worms beyond the Rhine. 
No tidings the king's lieges could more to joy incline. 

1715- 
The messengers sped forwards and now the tidings bare 
Of how the Niblung warriors within the Huns' land were. 
"Thou shouldst right well receive them, Kriemhilda, lad] 

mine; 
To thee come in great honour these brothers dear of thine." 

1716. 
Meanwhile, as dame Kriemhilda beside a window-sill 
Stood watching for her kinsmen, — as friends for others will, 
Lo, from her father's country there saw she many a man. 
The king, who heard the tidings, to laugh for glee began. 

1717- 
" Now joy of all who love me be mine ! " Kriemhilda said, 
" For hither come my kinsmen with many a shield new-made, 
And many a bright steel hauberk. Who would have gold of me. 
Let him my wrongs remember, my friend he e'er shall be ! "
