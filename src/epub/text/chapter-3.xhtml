			<h2>Adventure III.— HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS</h2>
			<p>
				<span><span>The Prince was little troubled by pangs of heartache yet!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The people's talk, however, erelong his ears beset:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How there was in Burgundia a maiden, passing fair;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For her sake joy and sorrow thereafter he did bear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The beauty of this maiden was famed far and wide;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her lofty mind, 'twas vaunted, excelled her beauty's pride,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And brought her many a wooer, ri ding to Gunther's land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who fain would see the damsel, and bid for that fair hand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And yet, however many contended for her love,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Kriemhilda felt in secret that none her heart could move;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>There was no man among them whose love she could reward;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That knight was still a stranger, who was to be her lord.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>But when the son of Sieglind to lofty love inclined,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Compared with his, all wooing was as an idle wind!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Right well, in sooth, deserved he to win so fair a bride:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Erelong the noble Kriemhild' stood at bold Siegfried's side.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>His followers and kinsmen, seeing that he would wed,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Did counsel that the maiden he to the altar led</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Should be by birth his equal,—for his, and for their sake:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Then," cried the gallant Siegfried, " Kriemhilda will I take!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" That beauteous young maiden of the Burgundian land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For her surpassing beauty. Right well I understand</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No Kaiser were so mighty but, should he need a wife.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That princess were fit consort to share his royal life."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>A rumour of the matter soon reached King Siegmund's ears</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>('Twas buzzed among the people); his mind was full of fears</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For this his son's intention;— that he was fain to wed</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The fair and lovely maiden, and would not be gainsaid.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Sieglinda also heard it, the noble monarch's wife,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And much heart-searching had she about her dear son's life:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For well she knew King Gunther, and his bold warrior-train.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They sought to turn the hero back from his wooing vain.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then outspake gallant Siegfried: " Beloved father mine,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The love of noble women I will for aye resign</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unless I woo where Love is, and give my heart its way.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Such is my purpose truly,—whatever men may say.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" If thou canst not forego her," the king said, " verily</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>My will shall be as thy will, and well it pleaseth me;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And I will help thee end it, and do the best I can:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet hath the royal Gunther full many a haughty man!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" If it were only Hagen, and no one else beside,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He hides 'neath courtly seeming such overweening pride,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That he'll do us a mischief,—of that I'm sore afraid,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If once we go a-wooing this fair and stately maid."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Shall that be hindrance to us? " asked Siegfried, fearlessly.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" If what I ask in kindness he venture to deny.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>My strong right hand shall win it! I'll wrest from him," quoth he,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Both land and lieges, surely, for all his subtlety."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the royal Siegmund, " I do mislike thy speech!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Should tidings thereof ever to the Rhine-border reach,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thou durst not ever after into that country ride.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Long have I known King Gunther, and King Gemot beside.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" By force can never any expect to win the maid</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Declared the good King Siegmund; "that hath been always said!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But if thou with thy warriors wilt to her country ride,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>An' we have any friends left, Til call them to thy side."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Far be it from my purpose," cried Siegfried, eagerly,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>"That when I ride to Rhine-land warriors should follow me,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Like an invading army! I should abhor this thing—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>By force the glorious maiden into my arms to bring!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" I will not owe her winning to any other hand;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I and eleven others will ride to Gunther's land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Your help, good father Siegmund, I, for this purpose, pray."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then gave they to his warriors both coloured stuffs and gray.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>His mother heard the tidings, the lady Siegelind,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She fell to grieving over her dear son in her mind;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Fearing lest she might lose him through some of Gunther's men.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The noble queen refrained not from bitter weeping then.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>This seeing, young lord Siegfried to her his way did make,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And unto his dear mother thus tenderly he spake:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" I prithee weep not, lady, because of mine intent;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I have no fear of foemen, nor of disparagement.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"Aid thou me in my journey to the Burgundian land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That I and my companions may bravely furnished stand</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In raiment that shall honour proud heroes, such as we,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then will I for this favour, aye thank thee fervently."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Since thou wilt not forego it," did Siegelind declare,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" ril help thee on thy journey, my only son and heir!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I will provide apparel, the best e'er warrior wore,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For thee and thy companions: and ye must take good store."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then bowed to the queen-mother Prince Siegfried, theyoung man.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He said: " On this my journey I'll take, if so I can,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>None save eleven warriors; for these be raiment made.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I long to see how fares it with Kriemhilda," he said.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>So Sieglind's beauteous ladies sat stitching, night and day,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>There were no idle fingers, and little rest or play,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until Prince Siegfried's raiment was ready to his hand.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He'd not forego his journey to the Burgundian land.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>His father bade him polish his knightly harness grand.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Wherewith he meant to ride out of royal Siegmund's land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eke the glitt'ring hauberks they likewise did prepare.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Together with stout helmets, and bucklers broad and fair.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The hour of their departure for Burgundy was nigh.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And men as well as women watched them forebodingly,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Lest they again should never come to their fatherland.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To pack their gear and armour the heroes gave command.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Their chargers were resplendent, their trappings of red gold;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No knight could well be prouder nor had more right to hold</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A high head, than Sir Siegfried and his eleven men.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He craved the king's permission to gallop Rhinewards then.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>With grief Siegmund and Sieglind accorded his request;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whom Siegfried sought to comfort, as tenderly he pressed.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He said: " Ye must not weep now through any care for me;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And fear not lest my life be in any jeopardy."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Sad-hearted were the warriors, and many a maiden wept:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Doubtless their hearts foreboded mischance for those who leapt</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That day into the saddle,—they dreamt these friends lay dead,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They had good cause for mourning, in sooth there was much need</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Upon the seventh morning, at Worms, on the Rhine shore,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Arrived the gallant horsemen; the raiment that they wore</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With ruddy gold was flashing, and all their trappings shone:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The chargers of bold Siegfried went pacing smoothly on.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Their bucklers were new-wrought ones, andlight and broadbeside,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And bright their helmets glittered, as unto court did ride</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Siegfried, the gallant chieftain, in royal Gunther's land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Such firie-apparelled heroes were ne'er seen on that strand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Theirlong-swords' points hung downwards unto the spurs they wore;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And sharp, too, were the javelins which these bold heroes bore.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The one that Siegfried carried was two spans in the blade,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Its twofold edge was deadly, and ghastly wounds it made.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>All gilded were the bridles they lightly held in hand;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And silken were their horse-girths; so came they to that land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The folk began on all sides on them to gape and stare.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then many of Gunther's people ran forth to meet them there.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Those high and mighty warriors, and knight as well as squire,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Went out to bid them welcome, as honour did require,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Receiving them with kindness into their master's land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Taking their horses, straightway, and bucklers from their hand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>They would have ta'en the chargers, and led them to the stall.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Had not the gallant Siegfried said out, before them all:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>"Let mine and my men's horses stay here, as now they be,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It is my will and purpose to ride hence presently!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" I pray you therefore tell me—whoever knows this thing</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Let him not hide it from me—where I can find your king,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Gunther, the mighty monarch of the Burgundian land? "</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then one among them told him, who knew where he did stand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" If you would find King Gunther, 'tis easy done, I trow,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In yonder hall I saw him, and thither you must go;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He stands among his heroes; and, if you'll thither wend.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Full many a glorious warrior you'll find with him, good friend! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Unto the king the tidings by this time had been told:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How warriors were arrived all gallant to behold,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who wore white, ghtt'ring mail-shirts, and raiment rich and grand.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And no one knew aught of them, in that Burgundian land.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then was the king astonished, and much he did inquire,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whence came these splendid warriors, in dazzling bright attire,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And with such well- wrought bucklers, so new and eke so broad;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It vexed the soul of Gunther that none could give him word.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then Ortwein, lord of Metz, spake, and answered thus the king</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>(Rich and high-couraged was he, and feared not anything):</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Since we know naught about them, bid someone straightway go</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And fetch my uncle Hagen, he'll see them, and may know.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" He knoweth all the kingdoms, and ev'ry stranger-land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If aught he wot anent them, he'll make us understand."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So the king sent to fetch him, him and his liegemen all ;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They watched his stately coming, with warriors, to the hall.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>What the king wanted of him? first, Hagen sought to know.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" There are within my palace strange warriors, I trow,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whom not a soul here knoweth; if thou didst them e'er see,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Declare it now, Sir Hagen, and tell the truth to me! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"That will I," answered Hagen, and to the window went j</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>One saw his keen glance wander, till on the guests it bent.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Well pleased him their equipment, and raiment equally:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But they were strangers to him, ne'er seen in Burgundy.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>He spake: " From whencesoever have come these cavaliers,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They must themselves be princes, or princes' messengers.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Their raiment is so splendid, their horses are so good;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>'Tis plain, where'er they come from, they are of noble blood.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>' And," furthermore said Hagen, " though hitherto, I ween</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The famous hero Siegfried, mine eyes have never seen,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I cannot help believing, how strange soe'er it be.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That yon proud knight, there standing, can be none else but he!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" He bringeth us new tidings, here into this our land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The hardy Niblungs slew he with his own hero-hand,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Both Nibelung and Schilbung, the sons of a rich king.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He hath wrought mighty wonders, by sheer strength vanquishing.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" For riding once, all lonely, and with no help at hand,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He came unto a mountain, (as I did understand,)</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Where lay the Niblungs' treasure, well watched by doughty men,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who all were strangers to him, until he met them then.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"The treasure of the Niblungs had just been taken then</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Out of a hollow mountain,—(Now hearken, my good men!)</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>While as the Niblung warriors to share it did prepare,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Young Siegfried came, and saw them: and had good cause to stare.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" He came so nigh unto them that he could see them all,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And they did also see him;— then one of them did call:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>' Here comes the mighty Siegfried, the Netherlander strong!'</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He met with strange adventures the Nibelungs among.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" The knight was well received by Schilbung and Nibelung;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And with one voice in counsel those noble lords and young</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Cried: ' Share for us the treasure, thou honourable man 1 '</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eagerly besought him: so he to share began.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" He saw so many jewels as I have heard men say,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That fivescore waggons scarcely would carry them away;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet more there was of red gold, from out the Nib'lungs' land:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all must be divided by gallant Siegfried's hand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" And unto him for wages they gave the Niblungs' sword:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But little they foreboded what would be their reward</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For rendering this service to Siegfried, the good knight;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ere he could end the sharing they had begun to fight.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"They had their friends anear them, twelve gallant armed men,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who all were mighty giants,—but what availed them then?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For Siegfried fell upon them and slew them in his ire,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Full seven hundred Niblungs, vanquished in battle dire,</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" With their good sword resistless, that was yclept ' Balmung.'</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And through the mighty terror that seized those warriors young,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Dread of the sword, and hero who bravely did it wield;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Their land and eke their castles unto him did they yield.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" The wealthy kings he also smote, till they both fell dead.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But he himself, through Albrich, was grievously bested,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who would avenge his masters upon the spot,—till he</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Found the great strength of Siegfried beyond his mastery.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" The sturdy dwarf was powerless against him in the fray.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Like lions wild to the mountain they twain then broke away.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Till the Tarnhelm  from Albrich he wrested; and thus lord</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Became the dreaded Siegfried of all the Niblung hoard.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"They who had dared the battle there, one and all, lay slain.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then bade he that the treasure be carried back again</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto the cave, whence erstwhile the Niblungs did it take.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And then did he stout Albrich his treasure-keeper make.</span></span>
			</p>
			<a>'■ The Hood of Darkness or Invisibility.</a>
			<p>
				<span><span>" By a great oath he made him unto him fealty swear,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To serve him in all service, no matter when or where."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So spake Hagen of Tronje, " That did he presently:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" There never was a warrior who had such might as he!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" And yet another story of Siegfried I have heard:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How he did slay a dragon, with his own hand and sword,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And in its blood he bathed him till horny grew his skin,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And thus no sword can cut him, as hath been often seen.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Then let us this young hero receive as best we may.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Lest we deserve his hatred and have to rue the day.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He is of such bold spirit 'twere best to be his friend:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He hath, by his strong right hand, wrought wonders without end."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then the great king said, " Truly, methinks that thou art right.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>See but how chivalrously he stands prepared to fight,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He and his warriors with him, a dauntless man is he!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We will go down to meet him, and greet him courteously."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Thou mayest," answered Hagen, " with honour do this thing,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>His ancestry is noble, his sire a wealthy king.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>One sees it in his bearing,—and, by the dear Lord Christ,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It is no trifle brings him, I warrant, on this quest!"</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the country's ruler: " Right welcome let him be,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That he is brave and noble hath aye been told to me;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We'll make his sojourn merry in our Burgundian land."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So saying, down went Gunther to where Siegfried did stand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The host and all his warriors received the guest so well</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That nothing to good breeding was lacking, sooth to tell.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The goodly man, on his side, bowed low before them there,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And thanked them for their greeting, so friendly and so fair.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" I marvel at these riddles," spake Gunther, suddenly,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Whence have you, noble Siegfried, come unto this country?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And for what purpose come you to Worms upon the Rhine?"</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The guest unto the king said: " To answer shall be mine.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" To me were told the tidings, erst in my fatherland,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That here with you were dwelling (which I would know firsthand,)</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The boldest of all warriors—oft said they so to me,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That ever monarch governed: lo, I am come to see!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Thy fame hath also reached me; I hear the knights declare</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That never king was bolder nor braver, anywhere.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Such is the common folk-talk o'er all the land, in sooth,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And I shall have no quiet until I know the truth.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" I also am a warrior, and shall too wear a crown;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And I shall ne'er content me until I win renown.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until the folk say of me, that I have proved my right</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To reign o'er land and people: my honour do I plight</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" And head thereto. And wert thou as bold as some men say,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I will now wrestle from thee whatever is thine to-day;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I care not who gainsay it, or who may like, or hate:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thy broad lands and thy castles shall mine be, soon or late! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The king did greatly marvel, and eke his liegemen all,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>At the strange declaration that from his lips did fall:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To take his kingdom from him! so that was his intent!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>His thanes all heard it, likewise, and fierce was their dissent.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Whereby have I deserved this? " Gunther the warrior cried,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" That lands my father governed, with honour, till he died,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Should be now wrested from us by force, by whomsoe'er?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That were to prove but poorly that we too knighthood bear."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Nought else will I," quoth Siegfried, " by that I fall or stand:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If thy strength cannot peace win for thine own fatherland,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then shall my strong hand rule it, and after me mine heir;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If thou dost win, thine be it, and we thy rule must bear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Thy heritage, mine also, are now alike at stake;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whichever of the other shall wholly conquest make</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To him shall all be subject,—the land and all its folk."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But Hagen and King Gemot in hasty answer spoke;</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Far be it from our purpose," spake Gemot presently,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" To conquer new possessions, and to cause death thereby</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>At hands of heroes; truly, we have a rich estate:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Which pays us due allegiance, nor seeks a better fate."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Round and about were standing his friends, in sullen mood;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The lord of Metz, Sir Ortwein, among the others stood;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He spake: " This friendly parley doth vex me sore, as knight,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Stout Siegfried unprovoked hath here challenged you to fight.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" If you and your two brethren were here, without defence,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And if he brought against you the army of a prince,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Methinks I could o'ermaster yea, e'en such doughty one!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And force this haughty warrior to change his braggart tone."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>This saying stirred fierce anger in him of Netherland.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He spake: "Ne'er shalt thou measure against my like thine hand!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I am a mighty king's son, and thou but a king's knight:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Twelve such as thou art could not withstand me in the fight!"</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Ortwein, the lord of Metz, then for swords called, lustily;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of Hagen, lord of Tronje, the sister's son was he;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That he had held his peace still seemed not to Gunther right.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But Gemot put his word in, the bold and ready knight.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>He thus spake unto Ortwein: " Now let thine anger be!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Siegfried hath not yet done us aught evil that I see,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Our difference in goodwill we yet may end, I deem.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And thus may gain his friendship; 'twill better us beseem."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the doughty Hagen: " Well do we to be wrath.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Both we, and all thy warriors, for hath he not come forth,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Here to the Rhine, to flout us? he might have let that be!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>My own good lords had never done him such injury."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>To this made answer Siegfried, that mightiest of men,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" If what I now have spoken offend you. Sir Hagen,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>You shall have eye-proof, shortly, how this my strong right hand</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Shall do great deeds of prowess in this Burgundian land."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" That I, for one, will hinder!" Gemot in answer said,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And unto all his warriors insulting speech forbade,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Because such speech did grieve him. Then into Siegfried's head</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Came thoughts of Lady Kriemhild, the lovely, peerless maid.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Is not all strife unseemly between us?" Gemot said;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" However many heroes fell by our prowess dead,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Small honour would by us be, by you small vantage won."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then answered him Prince Siegfried, the royal Siegmund's son:</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Wherefore delayeth Hagen? and Ortwein, what doth he,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That he and his companions haste not to strive with me?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>(Whereof he hath a' many e'en here in Burgundy)."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But it was Gernot's counsel that none should risk reply.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" You shall be welcome to us," continued Ute's son;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" You and the knightly comrades who come with you, each one;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Right gladly will we serve you, I and these kinsmen mine."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then for the guests were ordered goblets of Gunther's wine.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Loud spake the country's ruler: " All that we have is yours,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>What ye desire, in honour, we'll call no longer ours.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But gladly share it with you, be it or wealth, or blood."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>This wrought in good Sir Siegfried a somewhat softer mood.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The knights were soon relieved of all the gear they brought;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And lodgment was found for them,—the very best was sought</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For Siegfried's knightly followers; well were they lodged that day.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And now, in all Burgundia, right welcome guests were they.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>All honour too was shown them, on that and many a day,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A thousand times more honour than I can ever say!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>This had his boldness gained him; and this is true I state:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That seldom any saw him who long could bear him hate.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>On pastimes now and pleasure the kings and court were set.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But, whatsoe'er they started, he outstript all men yet:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For none could equal Siegfried, nor come his strength anear,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whether it were stone-putting, or shooting with the spear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And when by courtly custom they will'd their games to play</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In presence of the ladies,—these knights of humour gay,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Approving glances followed the prince of Netherland.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet his heart brooded ever on loftier love, at hand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Though to whate'er was passing he lent a ready mind.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>One gracious maiden ever he in his heart did find;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So, likewise, did the damsel, whom yet he had not seen,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Incline to him in secret, and talk of him, I ween.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>When in the court the young folk their warlike games began,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The knights and their attendants, Kriemhilda straightway ran</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And watched them from the window, king's daughter tho' she were,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Nor while it lasted did she for other pastime care.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And had he known she watched him, whom in his heart he bore,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It had been ample pleasure,—he would have asked no more.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And could his eyes have seen her, ye need not to be told</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No better bliss and greater for him this world could hold.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>When he, among the heroes, down in the court-yard stood,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Between the games, at leisure, as other warriors would;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So winsomely he stood there. Queen Siegelinda's son,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That the heart's love of many a noble dame he won.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And many a time he pondered: " How shall I e'er attain</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To see the noble damsel, whose love I seek to gain.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her whom I love so dearly, and have for many a day?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To me she's still a stranger, with sorrow I must say."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Whene'er the kings were minded to ride throughout their land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Their vassal knights had ever to follow, close at hand;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And Siegfried must be with them, which did the maid distress,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And he too suffered often, for her dear sake, no less.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>So dwelt he with the three kings (and 'tis all true you hear,)</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In Gunther's court and country, the space of one whole year;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all that time his Lady he never saw at all.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Through whom much love unto him and sorrow did befall.</span></span>
