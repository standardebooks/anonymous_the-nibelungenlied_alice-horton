			<h2>Adventure XXX.— HOW THEY KEPT WATCH AND WARD</h2>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now was the daylight ended and night began to close.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Amid the wayworn warriors disquietude arose</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For when they were to rest them and to their beds begone.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>This mooted was by Hagen; and soon it was made known.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Unto the host spake Gunther: " God grant you long to live!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>We now would hence to slumber; we pray thee leave to give.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>We'll come to-morrow morning if thou dost order so."</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Right pleasantly agreed he, and bade his guests to go.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>One saw the people crowding the guests on every side.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then Volker the undaunted unto the Hunfolk cried:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" How dare ye get in front of the warriors' very feet?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If ye will not give over with trouble ye will meet.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>" A fiddle-stroke so heavy on one of you I'll lay.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That, hath he a well-wisher, that same may rue the day.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Give place there to us warriors! 'twill be the best for you.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Folk call ye knights, but little ye have akin thereto."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Whilst spake the fiddle-player so wrathfully his mind,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The valiant Hagen turn'd him, and gave a glance behii) '</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Said he: " The gallant minstrel hath warn'd you prop t..i,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Ye heroes of Kriemhilda back to your homes go ye.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>" The plan ye are devising will not come off, I trow.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Come back to-morrow morning if ye have aught to do.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And leave us weary strangers this night to rest in peace;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I ween that heroes ever so do in such-like case."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Anon the guests were taken into a roomy hall.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Which found they well provided, to suit the warriors all.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With richly furnish'd bedsteads, that were both wide and long.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The while Dame Kriemhild plotted to do them grievous wrong.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Right goodly mats from Arras all round about were spread.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of bright-hued wool-stuffs woven; and many a cover-bed</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Wrought of Arabian samite, the finest that might be;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Whereon were borders broider'd that shone right gloriously.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The coverlets of ermine did many a man espy,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And others of black sable, whereunder they might lie</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And pass the night in comfort until the dawn of day.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>A king and all his courtiers so softly never lay.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>" O woe, for this night's sojourn! " so spake young Giselher</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" And woe for all my comrades who hither with us fare 1</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Howbeit that my sister so kind a bidding gave,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By cause of her, I fear me, we all our deaths shall have."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>let your mind be easy," Hagen the thane answer'd:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>' 1 wijj from now till morning myself keep watch and ward;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Aiiu lyell I swear to guard you until the break of day.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Till then be all untroubled; then, save himself who may! "</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then bow'd they all before him and gave him thanks therefore,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And to their beds betook them: nor was it long before</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Laid down in rest and slumber was every goodly man.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To don his arms the hero—Hagen the bold—began.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then up and spake the minstrel, Volker the gallant thane:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" If thou dost not disdain it, then, Hagen, I am fain</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To-night to keep guard with thee, until the morning break."</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Right heartily the hero his thanks to Volker spake:</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>" Now God in Heaven reward you, Volker, my comrade true!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To none in all my troubles save only unto you</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Would I for aidance turn me, if need should e'er befall.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>One day I will repay you, if Death do not forestall."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then in their shining raiment they twain their bodies clad,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And each of them his buckler upon his forearm had.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They went without the castle to stand the gateway by.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And there the guests they guarded: 'twas done right faithfully.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Volker the ever-ready then from his arm unbraced</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>His shield—it was a good one—which 'gainst the wall he placed.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Back to the hall he hasten'd, and there his fiddle seized.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And as became a hero, his friends therewith he pleased.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Beneath the doorway sat he upon a seat of stone;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>A braver fiddle-player in sooth had ne'er been known.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With such sweet-sounding music upon the strings he play'd,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That all the high-born strangers their thanks to Volker paid.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The sweet clang of his viol made all the house resound.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>His strength and skill together right excellent were found.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>More softly and more sweetly to fiddle he began,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And lull'd upon their couches full many a troubled man.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>And when they all were sleeping, and he thereof was sure,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The thane took up his buckler upon his arm once more.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And went outside the chamber before the tower to stand,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To guard the sleeping strangers against Kriemhilda's band.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>When halfway spent the night was, or earlier it might be,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The gallant Volker, watching, a shining helm could see</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Far off amid the darkness. 'Twas one of Kriemhild's men,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who all to do a mischief unto the guests were fain.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then spake the fiddle-player: " My friend. Sir Hagen, there,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Together it is fitting that we this trouble share.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I've seen some folk in armour before the house but now.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Else I am much mistaken, they'll set on us, I trow."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Then hold thy peace," quoth Hagen, "and let them nearer come.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Or ever they can see us, our swords will have struck home</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And split their helmets for them, with double-handed might.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>We'll send them back to Kriemhild, methinks, in sorry plight! "</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>One of the Hunnish warriors had soon enough espied</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That guarded was the doorway; how suddenly he cried:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" The matter we intended, in sooth will not go well.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I see the fiddle-player standing as sentinel!</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>" A brightly polish'd helmet upon his head hath he</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of pure, hard-temper'd metal, and strong, and blemish-free.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>His hauberk's rings are glowing as fiery embers would.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By him stands also Hagen: the guests have watchmen good."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Forthwith they turn'd them backwards. When Volker that espied,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Again to his companion in wrathful voice, he cried:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" Now let me from the palace after the warriors go;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of Dame Kriemhilda's liegemen somewhat I fain would know."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>" Nay, do it not," said Hagen; "I pray you by my love!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These ever-ready warriors, if from the house you move.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Would with their swords, I doubt not, bring you such straits to face,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That I should have to help you, were 't death to all my race.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>" For whilst we two together are busy in the fray.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Some two or four among them will to the house away,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And quickly force an entrance, and some foul mischief do</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Unto our sleeping comrades, which we shall ever rue."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then Volker spake in answer: " Let it be settled so;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But that I've seen them coming at least we'll let them know,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So Kriemhild's men hereafter shall never dare deny</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That they would fain against us have wrought vile treachery."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>With that, towards them Volker sent forth a lusty shout:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" Ye nimble knights, in armour why go ye thus about?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Ye warriors of Kriemhilda, if ye on foray ride,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Myself and my companion ye should have at your side! "</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>No word there came in answer. Then wrathful wax'd his mood:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" Fie on ye, skulking rascals! " shouted the hero good;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>" Would ye have caught us sleeping, and murder'd every one?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So foul a deed on heroes hath never yet been done."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Unto the queen right truly was told how lucklessly</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Her messengers had prospered. Good cause for grief had she.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then otherwise contrived she: so cruel was her mood;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By which ere long to perish were heroes bold and good.</span>
